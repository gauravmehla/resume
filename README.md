# Resume

This project contains the LaTeX source code for a resume.

## Structure

The main file is `resume.tex`, which includes the following sections:

- Education
- Technical Skills
- Publications
- Recent Projects

## Building

To build the resume, you will need a LaTeX environment. Once you have that set up, you can build the resume with the following command:

```sh
pdflatex resume.tex
```

This will generate a resume.pdf file.
